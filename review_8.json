        "comment": "We first like to thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback and suggestions.\n\nWe acknowledge that the linear and PNL ICA problems are more or less solved. However, we respectfully disagree that we should drop the treatment of these problems because we still think it is interesting that they can be solved with a new approach which in our opinion is very different from previous methods. This was not obvious to us when we started our research. \n\nA better definition of the version of the non-linear problem would indeed have been desirable in the context of source separation. While we presented the overcomplete case as a first step for evaluating the method, we surely realize that it doesn't come with any theoretical guarantees and that the obtained correlation scores are limited in interpretability. We adjusted the text to make this more clear. \n\nThe alternative to use estimates of the mutual information is certainly something we considered for both evaluation and model selection but this proved to be difficult in general. We tried both Kraskov's nearest-neighbor estimator and the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion but both these estimators typically seemed to consider the features fully independent during most stages of training and don't take into account how informative they are about the input. We still like to thank the reviewer for motivating us to pursue this direction further and like to hear more in detail what is meant with the \"quality of the low-dimensional data manifold\". If there is some principled way of measuring the latter we would certainly like to investigate it.\n\nThanks.\n\n"
