        "title": "Proposed Wasserstein GAN: not well-suited to ICA",
        "rating": "3: Clear rejection",
        "review": "The focus of the paper is independent component analysis (ICA) and its nonlinear variants such as the post non-linear (PNL) ICA model. Motivated by the fact that estimating mutual information and similar dependency measures require density estimates and hard to optimize, the authors propose a Wasserstein GAN (generative adversarial network) based solution to tackle the problem, with illustrations on 6 (synthetic) and 3-dimemensional (audio) examples. The primary idea of the paper is to use the Wasserstein distance as an independence measure of the estimated source coordinates, and optimize it in a neural network (NN) framework.\n\nAlthough finding novel GAN applications is an exciting topic, I am not really convinced that ICA with the proposed Wasserstein GAN based technique fulfills this goal.\n \nBelow I detail my reasons:\n\n1)The ICA problem can be formulated as the minimization of pairwise mutual information [1] or one-dimensional entropy [2]. In other words, estimating the joint dependence of the source coordinates is not necessary; it is worthwhile to avoid it.\n\n2)The PNL ICA task can be efficiently tackled by first 'removing' the nonlinearity followed by classical linear ICA; see for example [3].\n\n3)Estimating information theoretic (IT) measures (mutual information, divergence) is a quite mature field with off-the-self techniques, see for example [4,5,6,8]. These methods do not estimate the underlying densities; it would be superfluous (and hard).\n\n4)Optimizing non-differentiable IT measures can computationally quite efficiently carried out in the ICA context by e.g., Givens rotations [7]; differentiable ICA cost functions can be robustly handled by Stiefel manifold methods; see for example [8,9].\n\n5)Section 3.1: This section is devoted to generating samples from the product of the marginals, even using separate generator networks. I do not see the necessity of these solutions; the subtask can be solved by independently shuffling all the coordinates of the sample.\n\n6)Experiments (Section 6): \ni) It seems to me that the proposed NN-based technique has some quite serious divergence issues: 'After discarding diverged models, ...' or 'Unfortunately, the model selection procedure also didn't identify good settings for the Anica-g model...'.\nii) The proposed method gives pretty comparable results to the chosen baselines (fastICA, PNLMISEP) on the selected small-dimensional tasks. In fact, [7,8,9] are likely to provide more accurate (fastICA is a simple kurtosis based method, which is \na somewhat crude 'estimate' of entropy) and faster estimates; see also 2).\n\nReferences:\n[1] Pierre Comon.
