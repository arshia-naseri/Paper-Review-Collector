        "abstract": "We explore the role of multiplicative interaction as a unifying framework to describe a range of classical and modern neural network architectural motifs, such as gating, attention layers, hypernetworks, and dynamic convolutions amongst others.\nMultiplicative interaction layers as primitive operations have a long-established presence in the literature, though this often not emphasized and thus under-appreciated. We begin by showing that such layers strictly enrich the representable function classes of neural networks. We conjecture that multiplicative interactions offer a particularly powerful inductive bias when fusing multiple streams of information or when conditional computation is required. We therefore argue that they should be considered in many situation where multiple compute or information paths need to be combined, in place of the simple and oft-used concatenation operation. Finally, we back up our claims and demonstrate the potential of multiplicative interactions by applying them in large-scale complex RL and sequence modelling tasks, where their use allows us to deliver state-of-the-art results, and thereby provides new evidence in support of multiplicative interactions playing a more prominent role when designing new neural network architectures.",

                    "review": "This paper presents multiplicative interaction as a unified characterization for representing commonly used model architecture design components (e.g. gating, attention layers and hypernetworks). Multiplicative interactions can be viewed as an effective way of integrating contextual information in a network. Through a series of thorough empirical experiments, this paper demonstrates superior performance on a variety of tasks (RL, sequence modeling) when a such multiplicative interaction module is incorporated.\n\nThe framework seems applicable for learning tasks where a latent variable or context embedding presents. And the paper hypothesizes that multiplicative interactions can help introduce desirable inductive biases, therefore leading to improved generalization performance. However, the theoretical intuition and justification for such hypothesis is missing, which weakens the contribution of the paper. \n\nIn Table 1, the model LSTM with Multiplicative Decoder has more parameters (105M) than the vanilla LSTM in comparison (88M). It\u2019d be good to provide a more fair comparison by slightly increasing the capacity of baseline LSTM model (e.g., using larger output dimension to match the capacity). This will rule out the cofounding factor that the improved performance is due to the algorithm instead of increased model capacity. \n\nIn Section 8, it\u2019d be convincing if the authors can also report results for replacing default LSTM cell with multiplicative interactions. In paragraph 3, the authors only discussed the feasibility conceptually, without providing experimental results to support this argument. \n"

This allows understanding of both efficacy of multiplicative interaction (i.e., MI vs MLP), and the common between multiplicative-type models (e.g., hypernetworks, FiLM, gating,  attention etc). The authors also find MI models able to achieve a state-of-the-art performance on language modeling (WikiText-103) and reinforcement learning problems(DMLAB-30), along with several toy examples. \n\nStrengths: \n*The discussed MI subject is important research area, the paper presents the vast related work, proven by the fact MI techniques appears in many recent models.\n* The authors  did comprehensive evaluation to show importance and usefulness of multiplicative interactions. A  toy regression experiment to show superiority of MI vs MLP . A Reinforcement learning task, i.e DMLAB-30 on par with the state-of-the-art model, but with simple model (i.e., less parameters). A sequence prediction with an alternative embedding technique that improves both accuracy and number of needed parameters. \n* The paper is of high quality: well organized, clear, with good supporting figures.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n* I suggest a better explanation how the suggested models compare to state-of-the-art models.  Currently, it is hard to assess the impact. For instance, proposed model alternate existing baselines, such as PopArt, or is completely novel?  \n* Although mentioned, it's not the focus of this work, the paper should have discussed attention models more.  Specifically recent years multimodal attention relied on multiplicative interactions. Therefore, at least in this domain multiplicative interactions are not \"under-appreciated\". Relevant papers: [1, 2, 3, 4] - advancement of multiplicative interactions over the years, [5] - introduce co-attention, [6] - introduce higher-order interactions (between three vectors), [7] - introduce bilinear attention .\n\nTo conclude, multiplicative interactions are extremely important, and I find the paper exploration useful. In addition,  the paper is of high quality, and with satisfied experiments to prove their claims. I do suggest a better discussion about multimodal attention networks, which are relevant examples.\n\n[1] - Ask, Attend and Answer: Exploring Question-Guided Spatial Attention for Visual Question Answering; Xu et al.\n[2] - Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual Question Answering and Visual Grounding; Fukui et al.\n[3] - Hadamard Product for Low-rank Bilinear Pooling; Kim et al.\n[4] - Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling with Co-Attention Learning for Visual Question Answering; Yu et al.\n[5] - Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering; Lu et al.\n[6] - High-Order Attention Models for Visual Question Answering; Schwartz et al.\n[7]  - Bilinear Attention Networks; Kim et al. \n ",

The analysis and math are clear, and the main points are made with neither too many nor too few equations. Authors cast several other approaches (gating, attention, Hypernets) within the same formulation, which while not being groundbreaking or overly novel is nice to see compiled into this particular form.\n\nDecision: weak accept.\n\nPros:\n - I can imagine any researcher getting into the field and interested in this sort of thing reading this paper as a canonical, concise, and moderately thorough intro to the concept.\n - Beautiful drawing\n\nCons:\n - Experiments are a little light. To make the paper more thorough, it would be nice to see cases where multiplicative interactions are *not* needed, e.g. if one sticks multiplicative interactions in a network trained to classify MNIST or CIFAR-10, do they help at all? If not, why not?\n - Further ablation studies would also benefit the paper. For example, in the language modeling section, how would the results change with varying bottleneck size? With a completely diagonal approximation? Finally, LSTMs already have multiplicative interactions in them (via gating, as mentioned in the paper). Would the proposed form of multiplicative interaction obviate the need for LSTM gating all together?\n\nWith additional experiments this paper could be a strong accept and recommended reading for many first year grad students. As is, it\u2019s probably still worth accepting.\n",
