        "comment": "Thank you for your response.\n\nMaximizing independence under general mixing conditions does not necessarily lead to the recovery of the underlying independent sources (even up to the standard ambiguities); this is one of the major motivations why the linear and post-nonlinear ICA (PNL-ICA) tasks have been considered in the literature.\n\nConstructing new general ICA 'solvers' can have certain impact, however the merits of the proposed heuristic are not illustrated/clear.\n1)In case of linear and post-nonlinear ICA: Available off-the-shelf methods can solve 1-2 orders-of-magnitude larger tasks than the ones studied with high accuracy in a numerically robust way.\n2)For general non-linear ICA tasks: \n-One should investigate whether techniques maximizing an independence measure lead to provable solution, find the hidden sources. \n-In fact, using approximate independence measures [such as (4)] raises further unhandled issues. \n\nTo sum up, it would be crucial to (i) understand the validity domain of the studied scheme, (ii) make it comparable to existing methods (in terms of scalability, precision and robustness; at least in the ICA and PNL-ICA settings), and (iii) construct new well-posed non-linear ICA tasks.\n\nMy opinion has not changed."
